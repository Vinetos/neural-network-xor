# neural-network-xor
Implements a neural network learning XOR gate in your favourite languages !

# File architecture
To avoid problems, follow this architecture :
```
<root>
  |_ python
      |_ <username>
          |_ my file.py
          |_ network.py
  |_ java
      |_ <username>
          |_ Main.java
          |_ Test.java
``` 

To increase lisibility, I recommend to create only **ONE FILE**.
For instance, `main.py` should contains all the code needed to run the project.

# XOR gate

An XOR gate (sometimes referred to by its extended name, Exclusive OR gate) is a digital logic gate with two or more inputs and one output that performs exclusive disjunction. The output of an XOR gate is __true only when exactly one of its inputs is true__. If both of an XOR gate's inputs are false, or if both of its inputs are true, then the output of the XOR gate is false.

If an XOR gate has more than two inputs, then its behavior depends on its implementation. In the vast majority of cases, an __XOR gate will output true if an odd number of its inputs is true__.
